# Analyzer Rule Engine

In this project, we are writing a rule engine that can use pluggable providers for rules to make a consistent way to execute rules for Konveyor.

One of the primary drivers for this repository is adding providers for specific languages using the Language Server Protocol. Today these providers are in tree, but we will be moving them out in the future.

## Quick Demo

If you would like to run a quick demo we have a Dockerfile that has all the dependencies.

To run this demo build the containers:

```
$ podman build -f Dockerfile -t quay.io/konveyor/analyzer-lsp
$ podman build -f demo.Dockerfile -t test-analyzer-engine
```

This will build the engine, and include the current set of rules and examples in the container to be used.

To run the rules (rule-example.yaml) against the examples, and save the output to the `demo-output.yaml` file:

```
$ podman run -v $(pwd)/demo-output.yaml:/analyzer-lsp/output.yaml:Z test-analyzer-engine
```

## Running from source code

To run the engine from source code, you need to:

* Configure providers. By default, providers are configured in `provider_settings.json`. See [Providers](./docs/providers.md) for instructions on configuring providers.
* Configure rules. By default, rules are present in `rules_example.yaml`. See [Rules](./docs/rules.md) for details on rule format.

Once the providers are configured, you can run:

```sh
go run cmd/analyzer/main.go
```

CLI Options:

```sh
Flags:
      --analysis-mode string        select one of full or source-only to tell the providers what to analyize. This can be given on a per provider setting, but this flag will override
      --context-lines int           When violation occurs, A part of source code is added to the output, So this flag configures the number of source code lines to be printed to the output. (default 10)
      --dep-label-selector string   an expression to select dependencies based on labels. This will filter out the violations from these dependencies as well these dependencies when matching dependency conditions
      --enable-jaeger               enable tracer exports to jaeger endpoint (default true)
      --error-on-violation          exit with 3 if any violation are found will also print violations to console
  -h, --help                        help for analyze
      --jaeger-endpoint string      jaeger endpoint to collect tracing data (default "http://localhost:14268/api/traces")
      --label-selector string       an expression to select rules based on labels
      --limit-code-snips int        limit the number code snippets that are retrieved for a file while evaluating a rule, 0 means no limit (default 20)
      --limit-incidents int         Set this to the limit incidents that a given rule can give, zero means no limit (default 1500)
      --no-dependency-rules         Disable dependency analysis rules
      --output-file string          filepath to to store rule violations (default "output.yaml")
      --provider-settings string    path to the provider settings (default "provider_settings.json")
      --rules stringArray           filename or directory containing rule files (default [rule-example.yaml])
      --verbose int                 level for logging output (default 9)
```

* See [label selector](./docs/labels.md#label-selector) for more info on `--label-selector` option.

## Code Base Starting Point

 Using the LSP/Protocal from ACME https://github.com/fhs/acme-lsp and stripping out anything related to serving, proxy or anything. Just keeping the types for communication

 Using JSONRPC2 from google.org/x/tools/internal. Copied and removed anything to do with serving.
